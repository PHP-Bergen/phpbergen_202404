# Introduction to dependency injection (DI)

* loose coupling enabled by DI.
* Maintainable code
* Easier to test

## Example
* [Hairdryers and loosely coupled code](at_the_hotel.md)

## Three
* UPS between socket and device.
    * Decorator design pattern - Intercepting implementation
    * Single Responsibility
    * Ability to incrementally add new functionality
* Composite design pattern
* Open/Closed principle. Extend application without changing exiting code.
    * Open for extensibility, closed for modification.
* Adapter pattern
